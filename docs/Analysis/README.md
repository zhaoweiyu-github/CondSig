## CondSig-positive and -negative peaks for each CAP

### User can find the analyzed CondSig-positive/negative peaks with ATAC-seq peaks or with more than 10 occupied CAPs for each CAP by clicking the following link:
* [CondSig-positive/negative peaks with ATAC-seq peaks](https://compbio-zhanglab.org/CondSigDB/data/GitHub/component.peaks.classification.ca.tar.gz)
* [CondSig-positive/negative peaks with more than 10 occupied CAPs](https://compbio-zhanglab.org/CondSigDB/data/GitHub/component.peaks.classification.mo.tar.gz)

These peak files were analyzed to generate the plot in the Supplementary Figure S6 and S7 in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51426-2).
